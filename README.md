# Preprocessing and Tokenization with Stemming and Lemmatization for Arabic Sentences
Introduction
This script provides a preprocessing pipeline for Arabic sentences, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. It utilizes Qalsadi for Arabic lemmatization and ISRIStemmer for stemming.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

Qalsadi library for Arabic lemmatization (install via pip: pip install qalsadi)

ISRIStemmer library for Arabic stemming (install via pip: pip install ISRIStemmer)

# Implementing RNN and Transformer from Scratch
Introduction
This repository contains implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Transformer models from scratch using Python and NumPy.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the code.
Run python rnn.ipynb to train and test the RNN model.
Run python transformer.ipynb to train and test the Transformer model.

# Customization
You can adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, hidden size, number of layers, etc., by modifying the relevant variables in the code.
To train the models on your own dataset, replace the dummy data provided in the code with your dataset.
Credits
This implementation is inspired by the concepts presented in various research papers and online tutorials.
